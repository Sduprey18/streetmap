StreetMap Visualization

Visual map routing in java
 Usage



javac StreetMap.java


  - To display the map graphically, include the "show" option:


    java StreetMap input.txt show
  


  - To find and display the shortest path between two locations, include the "directions" option:

  
    java StreetMap input.txt directions startLocation endLocation
 

 Input Format

The input file should contain information about nodes (i) and roads (r) in the following format:

```
i nodeName latitude longitude
r roadID startNode endNode
```

 Map Rendering

The graphical rendering uses Java Swing and displays roads as lines on the map. Highlighted roads, representing the shortest path, are shown in red.

 Examples

- Show the map:


  java StreetMap input.txt show


- Show directions between two locations:


  java StreetMap input.txt directions startLocation endLocation


Ensure that you have a valid input file with the specified format.
